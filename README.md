# MINST-NN-from-Scratch

This was an attempt to build a neural netwrok from scratch by using just the Numpy libaray. The NN makes preidictions of the labels in the MINST dataset. 
The training accuracy was found to be ~82 % which can be improvided by adding more layers. 

The pdf document shows all the linear algebra calucations and equations used to build the NN.
